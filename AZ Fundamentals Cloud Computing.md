Cloud Computing

    metered self-provisioned IT services accessible over a network

Cloud Computing Characteristics

    - Resource Pooling (compute, network, and storage appears infinite to cloud tenant)
    - Broad access (a variety of devices can access the cloud resources via the network)
    - Metered usage (resource usage is tracked and monthly charges are base on the usage)
    - Rapid elasticity (more virtual machines, more storage, increased virtual machine power)
    - Self-provisioning (cloud user deploys and manages resources)
   

Virtualization does not mean cloud, and cloud computing requires virtualization


Could Computing benefits

    - no up-front capital expenditure
    - Cloud provider security accreditations
    - Quick IT solution deployment
    - Underlying technical complexities are hidden
    - Less on-premises space, power, HVAC
